## About

**ABM Sheets** is a research project conducted by _Bc. Tomáš Boďa_ under the guidance of _Mgr. Tomáš Petříček, Ph.D._ at the _Faculty of Mathematics and Physics_ at _Charles University_ in Prague, Czech republic. Its primary goal is to address limitations of conventional spreadsheet tools by extending the spreadsheet paradigm with built-in support for discrete time, allowing cells to reference their own values from previous time steps. This addition extends the spreadsheet with the third dimension of time, which allows developing a wider range of models using traditional spreadsheet computations.
