		Spreadsheets are powerful tools for data analysis and modeling, but they are inherently limited to two dimensions - rows and columns, making it difficult to represent systems that evolve over time. This limitation poses challenges for domains like agent-based modeling, physics simulations, or financial market analysis, where the concept of time is fundamental. In particular, agent-based models require tracking multiple agents, each with evolving attributes, across discrete time steps - something traditional spreadsheets struggle to express without resorting to duplication and convoluted formulas.
		
		We address this limitation by extending the spreadsheet paradigm with a built-in support for discrete time, allowing cells to reference their own values from previous time steps directly. This extension preserves the familiar spreadsheet paradigm while adding a powerful new dimension of time. With this approach, users can build and explore dynamic models, such as agent-based simulations with the same ease as traditional spreadsheet calculations. In this document, we demonstrate how this time-aware spreadsheet enables new kinds of simulations and iterative processes that are impractical or impossible to implement in conventional spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.

		Let's start by showcasing ABM Sheets on a simple physics simulation of shooting a cannonball in a two-dimensional space.

		Live demo of the model can be found on [this link](https://abm-sheets-web.vercel.app/spreadsheet?projectId=1ae56eb2-8b98-4a0d-837d-3524b8a169e4).

		A cannonball has the following properties:

		- `X` - the x coordinate
		- `Y` - the y coordinate
		- `ANGLE` - initial shooting angle
		- `SPEED` - initial shooting speed
		- `VX` - the x velocity
		- `VY` - the y velocity

		<br />
		Then there is a list of constant values:

		- `GRAVITY` - gravity
		- `AIR_RESISTANCE` - air resistance
		- `TIME_FACTOR` - time factor

		<br />
		The physics simulation of a cannonball is modelled as following:

		- `ANGLE = 20` (can be tweaked)
		- `SPEED = 50` (can be tweaked)
		- `VX`
			- initially set to `SPEED * COS(RADIANS(ANGLE))`
			- then updated as `VX + -AIR_RESISTANCE * VX * TIME_FACTOR`
		- `VY`
			- initially set to `SPEED * SIN(RADIANS(ANGLE))`
			- then updated as `VY + (-GRAVITY + -AIR_RESISTANCE * VY) * TIME_FACTOR`

		<br />
		Finally, the x and y coordinates rendered in the graph are modelled as following:

		- `X = X + VX * TIME_FACTOR`
		- `Y = Y + VY * TIME_FACTOR`

		<H2WithID id="introduction">Introduction</H2WithID>

		Spreadsheets are among the most widely used tools for data analysis, planning, and modeling due to their flexibility, accessibility, and low barrier to entry. They offer a familiar interface based on a two-dimensional grid of cells, which makes them ideal for a broad range of applications, from financial modeling to project management and scientific calculations. However, their core structural simplicity also introduces limitations, particularly when representing models that extend beyond two dimensions.

		In recent years, several research efforts have explored ways to expand the capabilities of spreadsheets to address more complex computational needs. [Espalier](https://sdg.csail.mit.edu/project/espalier/), for example, introduces a novel paradigm that combines spreadsheet usability with SQL-like expressiveness, enabling users to build rich organizational applications while editing hierarchical structured data within a visual environment. [Nezt](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3191697.3214343) offers a live programming environment inspired by spreadsheets but enhanced with hierarchical cells and reusable custom functions, aiming to support application prototyping and scientific computing with greater expressiveness. Addressing the growing importance of real-time applications, a prototype [spreadsheet model for streaming data](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2702123.2702587) demonstrates how users can stream and manipulate web-based data within a spreadsheet using temporal metadata and dynamic formulas. Finally, [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7476773) looks at spreadsheets from a broader perspective and treats them as a programming language, highlighting their liveness, directness, and ease of deployment, while surveying research directions in spreadsheet software engineering such as testing, refactoring, and clone detection.

		Another domain that challenges the traditional spreadsheet paradigm is agent-based modeling (ABM). ABMs simulate the behavior of individual entities - agents, over time, often requiring the tracking of multiple attributes per agent across discrete time steps. This naturally introduces three essential dimensions - the population of agents, their attributes, and time. Attempting to represent this three-dimensional structure within a conventional spreadsheet often results in workarounds, which quickly become error-prone and difficult to maintain, especially as the model complexity grows.

		Despite these challenges, there is strong motivation to bring time-aware simulations into the spreadsheet environment. Spreadsheets offer a transparent, interactive, and user-friendly platform that encourages experimentation and rapid prototyping. Making them more compliant with complex modeling would significantly lower the barriers to entry for users without formal programming experience, while still supporting powerful and expressive simulations. By embedding time into the core data structure, ABM Sheets provides a seamless way to model state changes over time, making it a powerful tool for agent-based modeling and other time-aware simulation approaches.

		<H2WithID id="contributions">Contributions</H2WithID>

		This paper makes the following contributions:

		- **Identification of a gap in conventional spreadsheet modeling** \
		Through formative user interviews and analysis of common modeling scenarios, we identify a core limitation of traditional spreadsheets in representing systems that evolve over time, particularly in the context of agent-based modeling and dynamic simulations

		- **Design and implementation of a time-extended spreadsheet model** \
		We introduce an extension to the traditional spreadsheet paradigm that integrates discrete time as a first-class concept. Our prototype allows cells to reference values from previous time steps directly, enabling natural expression of stateful and time-dependent computations.

		- **Demonstration through case studies** \
		We validate the expressiveness and utility of our time-aware spreadsheet model by implementing three case studies: an agent-based model, a physical system simulation, and a financial process. These examples highlight scenarios that are cumbersome or infeasible to construct using conventional spreadsheet tools like Excel or Google Sheets.

		<H2WithID id="time-aware-simulations">Time-aware Simulations</H2WithID>

		One of the simulation domains that utilize discrete time is agent-based modeling (ABM). Agent-based models simulate the behavior and interaction of individual entities called agents over time. Each agent has a defined set of behavioral rules, based on which they decide which actions they are going to take.
		
		This inherently introduces three dimensions to the model - a set of agents, a set of attributes for each agent and discrete time. This naturally poses challenges for conventional spreadsheet interfaces due to their two-dimensional structure and often results in workarounds, such as modeling the third dimension by duplicating tables of the other two dimensions. This approach, however, quickly becomes error-prone and difficult to maintain, especially as the model complexity grows.

		Physics simulations often work with time too, for instance the cannonball simulation presented at the beginning of this paper. Although simple physics models can be handled using an analytical approach, more complex models that use differential equations need to be simulated, which becomes difficult to do in conventional spreadsheet interfaces.

		<H2WithID id="formative-interviews">Formative Interviews</H2WithID>

		Prior to implementing the system, a series of formative interviews was conducted to discover limitations of the traditional spreadsheet software, such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, when applied to agent-based modeling tasks. Participants were given a simple agent-based modeling scenario and asked to implement it in Microsoft Excel using whatever approach they found most appropriate.

		<H3WithID id="participants">Participants</H3WithID>

		The study included four participants. Two had extensive experience with Microsoft Excel and used it regularly in either professional or personal contexts. The other two were university students studying computer science, with limited prior exposure to spreadsheet tools, but with solid foundation in programming concepts.

		<H3WithID id="assignment">Assignment</H3WithID>

		The modeling assignment involved simulating a footrace between agents. Each agent had an individual speed and advanced through a one-dimensional space based on that speed. The simulation required agents to update their positions over discrete time steps, and to halt once any agent crossed the finish line — a classic example of an agent-based system with evolving state and conditional behavior over time.

		<H3WithID id="findings">Findings</H3WithID>

		Interestingly, one participant chose to avoid the time-stepped approach altogether, instead calculating agents' final positions using direct formulas. When asked why they opted to bypass modeling with time steps, they explained:

		*"I guess because once you set the rows to time steps, you have lost a dimension of your spreadsheet and so now everything is one-dimensional and everything about the dynamics has to be embedded in a single formula and that can get really complicated, so I was trying to get away from not having to do that for as long as possible. You've only got two dimensions, and if you use one for time, everything else becomes miserable."*

		This feedback directly supports the core hypothesis behind ABM Sheets - that embedding time as a native dimension in spreadsheet environments could alleviate major usability and expressiveness issues in modeling dynamic systems.

		Another participant offered a valuable reflection on the enduring appeal of spreadsheet software:

		*"One of the benefits of Excel, as you probably know, is just the whip attitude of it, you know, this kind of interactive, reactive programming environment. The ability to mix data and formulas/programming in the same environment is extremely attractive."*

		This insight underscores the power of spreadsheets as hybrid tools for both data manipulation and lightweight programming. ABM Sheets aims to build on this foundation by preserving the interactivity and flexibility of traditional spreadsheets while extending their capabilities to support time-evolving simulations in a more intuitive and maintainable way.

		Both of these insights gave us valuable information that strenghtens the idea of ABM Sheets.

		<H2WithID id="system-overview">System Overview</H2WithID>

		ABM Sheets is designed to closely resemble traditional spreadsheet software, particularly Microsoft Excel, in order to minimize the learning curve for existing users. The user interface, formula syntax, and user interaction patterns are intentionally modeled after familiar spreadsheet conventions. This ensures that users can quickly adapt to the system while benefiting from its extended capabilities.

		<H3WithID id="built-in-discrete-time">Built-in Discrete Time</H3WithID>

		The core innovation in ABM Sheets is the integration of discrete time as a native feature of the spreadsheet environment. This addition introduces several fundamental changes to how cells behave and how formulas are interpreted.

		Most notably, cells in ABM Sheets are allowed to reference themselves within their own formulas. When a cell references itself, the value retrieved corresponds to the previous time step. To enable this behavior, each time-dependent cell must be initialized with a starting value — referred to as the default formula — from which the simulation can evolve over time.

		Each cell in ABM Sheets can therefore have two formulas:

		- **default formula** - defines the cell's value at the initial time step (t = 1)
		- **primary formula** - defines the cell's value in all subsequent time steps (t > 1), potentially referencing its own prior state or the states of other cells 

		If a cell attempts to reference itself without a defined default formula, the evaluation results in an error due to the absence of an initial state.

		To define both formulas within a single cell, ABM Sheets uses a dual-assignment syntax - the first `=` introduces the default formula, and the second `=` introduces the primary formula. If only one formula is provided, it is treated as the primary formula and applies uniformly across all time steps without referencing prior state.

		To define a simple counter that starts at `1` and increments by `1` at each time step, the formula in cell `A1` would be `= 1 = A1 + 1`:

		- at time step `1`, `A1` evaluates to `1` (the default formula)
		- at time step `2`, `A1` evaluates to `1 + 1 = 2` (the primary formula)
		- at time step `3`, `A1` evaluates to `2 + 1 = 3`, and so on

		<H3WithID id="cell-references">Cell References</H3WithID>

		In a spreadsheet model where cells reference themselves arbitrarily, a mechanism to ensure that all cells are evaluated in correct and consistent order must be enforced. For instance, if `A1` references `B1`, the system must make sure to evaluate `B1` prior to `A1` in order for `A1` to have the most up-to-date value of `B1`.

		To enforce this ordering, ABM Sheets employs a topological sorting algorithm that analyzes cell dependencies and determines a valid evaluation sequence. This guarantees that each cell is computed only after all the cells it depends on have been evaluated.

		However, this approach can encounter issues when cyclic dependencies exist — when two or more cells depend on each other either directly or indirectly. For instance:

		- cell `A1` with formula `= B1`
		- cell `B1` with formula `= A1`

		This configuration creates a circular dependency, which prevents topological sorting and leads to an evaluation error. ABM Sheets addresses this problem by leveraging default formulas to break dependency cycles across time steps. By providing an initial value through a default formula, a cell can be evaluated independently at the first time step, allowing dependent cells to reference its value without forming an immediate cycle. For instance:

		- `A1` formula is `= 1 = B1`
		- `B1` formula is `= A1`

		In this revised version, `A1` is initialized to `1` at the first time step. As a result, `B1` can safely reference `A1`, and both cells can be evaluated without creating a circular dependency in the current time step. In subsequent time steps, values propagate forward using the established evaluation order, maintaining consistency and correctness.

		This mechanism allows ABM Sheets to support recursive and interdependent cell logic while preserving the integrity of the simulation across discrete time steps.

		<H3WithID id="wolf-sheep-predation">Wolf-sheep Predation</H3WithID>

		The wolf-sheep predation model explores the stability of predator-prey ecosystems. It is an agent-based simulation that consists of two types of agents - predators (wolves) and prey (sheep). Wolves try to eat the sheep in order to survive. If their energy runs out, they die and respawn only after eating a sheep that crosses their path. On the other hand, if a sheep gets eaten, it dies and respawns after a certain time passes.

		Live demo of the model can be found on [this link](https://abm-sheets-web.vercel.app/spreadsheet?projectId=45da2f86-6ea2-40c8-b063-ab66eee61d58).

		<Video controls>
			<source src="/wolf-sheep-predation-showcase.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>
		</Video>

		We can observe that at first, the population of sheep decreases as the wolves eat the sheep. However, when there is less sheep for the wolves to eat, their energy runs out after a short period of time, resulting in the decrease of the wolf population. With this decrease, the sheep can regenerate and respawn and with less wolves to eat them, they prosper. However, with more sheep in the area, there is a higher probability of an encounter with the wolves, resulting in the increase of the wolf population.

		Both the wolves and the sheep have `X` and `Y` coordinates representing their position in the area. We have a helper column `position` calculated as `CONCAT(X, Y)`, which gives us a unique identifier of their position.
		
		Wolves have a column `sheep ID` which represents the ID of the sheep in the same position as the corresponding wolf. In each step, if a sheep doesn't cross the wolf's position, their health is decremented by 1. Otherwise their health is regenerated as they eat the sheep. This is modelled as:

		`IF(AND(SHEEP_ID != "NONE", SHEEP_STATUS == "ALIVE"), MIN(MAX_HEALTH, HEALTH + 5), MAX(0, HEALTH - 1))`

		Sheep's logic is implemented in a similar way, however, when they are eaten by a wolf, they are resurrected after a certain period of time passes. The respawn time of the sheep is modelled as:

		`RESPAWN = IF(STATUS == "ALIVE", 0, IF(AND(PREV(STATUS) == "ALIVE", STATUS == "DEAD"), 10, RESPAWN - 1))`

		Notice the use of `PREV` in this formula. The `PREV` function takes in a cell reference and returns its value in the previous time step. In this way, we can observe the change of the sheep's `STATUS` in time and respond to the changes by updating the `RESPAWN` accordingly. The sheep's `STATUS` is modelled as follows:

		`STATUS = IF(STATUS == "DEAD", IF(RESPAWN > 0, "DEAD", "ALIVE"), IF(WOLF_ID != 0, "DEAD", "ALIVE"))`

		If the sheep is alive and a wolf crosses their way, the sheep becomes dead. If it is dead and the respawn time is greater then zero, it stays dead, otherwise is becomes alive again. The two above formulas inherently use the built-in mechanism of discrete time to observe changes in time and respond to them accordingly.

		<H3WithID id="running-race">Running Race</H3WithID>

		The running race model is a simple agent-based simulation modeling a set of runners competing in a running race. Each runner has a certain speed assigned at the beginning and this speed is randomly incremented/decremented in each time step, not going below 0. If any agent crosses the finish line, the race stops and the winner is displayed.

		Live demo of the model can be found on [this link](https://abm-sheets-web.vercel.app/spreadsheet?projectId=5e09daf0-df10-490a-815c-27a50322cfc2).

		<Video controls>
			<source src="/running-race-showcase.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>
		</Video>

		Each runner has a `POSITION`, `SPEED` and an indicator of whether it has crossed the finish line labeled `FINISHED`.

		The `POSITION` is initially set to `0` and calculated as:
		
		`POSITION = POSITION + SPEED`.
		
		The `SPEED` is initially set to `RANDBETWEEN(1, 5)` and calculated as:
		
		`SPEED = MAX(1, SPEED + (RAND() - 0.5) * 2)`.

		The speed is randomly incremented/decremented in each new time step, but we make sure it never goes below `1` in order for the agents to always move forward. Lastly, for each agent we check whether they crossed the finish line using:

		`FINISHED = IF(POSITION >= FINISH_LINE, 1, 0)`

		Finally, we check if any runner has crossed the finish line by summing all `FINISHED` values and checking if their sum is greater than `0`:

		`ANY_FINISHED = IF(SUM(FINISHED_FIRST, FINISHED_LAST) > 0, 1, 0)`

		If any agent has finished the race, we stop updating the other agents' positions and speeds and the race has ended.

		<H3WithID id="hotellings-law">Hotelling's Law</H3WithID>

		The Hotelling's Law model examines the optimal pricing of goods that stores sell in order to maximize their profit. In this models, we have stores and customers placed randomly in a one-dimensional space (line). Each store is assigned a random pricing of their goods. In each new time step, each store attempts to increase/decrease the pricing of their goods to see if they can attract more customers. If so, the stores update their prices. In the graph, we can observe the changing prices of the three stores in the model.

		Live demo of the model can be found on [this link](https://abm-sheets-web.vercel.app/spreadsheet?projectId=e5777fbb-d03c-4e62-9282-69100f75c6d7).

		<Video controls>
			<source src="/hotellings-law-showcase.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>
		</Video>

		This model is quite complex and difficult to explain using sample formula code. The main idea is that we create an interest matrix where rows represent customers and columns represent stores. Each cell in the matrix represents the interest of the given customer for the given store, calculated as:

		`INTEREST = ABS(STORE_POSITION - CUSTOMER_POSITION) + STORE_PRICE`

		Each store tries to increment or decrement their price to see whether they can gain more customers with this new pricing strategy. For this, we create two new matrices with the same structure as the matrix above, but we count in the new incremented/decremented prices.

		Each customer looks at the interest matrix and chooses to go to the store with the lowest interest value. Each store then sums their total number of customers. This is performed also for the incremented/decremented interest rates. If a store gains more customers by either incrementing or decrementing their price, they update their current price based on the new best strategy. This process is repeated in each step of the simulation.

		<H2WithID id="limitations-and-future-improvements">Limitations & Future Improvements</H2WithID>

		While ABM Sheets introduces a novel approach to integrating discrete time into spreadsheets, several limitations and opportunities for improvement remain.

		<H3WithID id="limitations">Limitations</H3WithID>

		- **Limited Expressiveness for Non-Discrete Time** \
		The current model assumes a uniform, discrete time progression. Simulations involving continuous time, variable time steps, or asynchronous events are not naturally supported and would require significant workarounds.

		- **Debugging and Traceability** \
		While time-based formulas enhance expressiveness, they also introduce complexity in debugging. Tracing the origin of unexpected results across time steps and dependencies is non-trivial and may require better tooling support, which is not provided in the current version.

		- **Lack of Built-in Visualization Controls** \
		Although ABM Sheets provides simple visualisation capabilities, it does not suffice for complex time-aware simulations where plotting aggregated results is beneficial for understanding the simulation output. There is limited support for more sophisticated, interactive visualisations, such as heatmaps, spatial plots or agent trajectories.

		<H3WithID id="future-improvements">Future Improvements</H3WithID>

		- **Optimized Evaluation Engine** \
		In complex simulations with numerous tables and complex formulas across a large number of time steps, the evaluation's performace could get very slow. Incorporating techniques such as incremental recomputation, parallel evaluation, or just-in-time compilation could significantly enhance performance for larger models.

		- **Improved Error Reporting** \
		A step-through debugger or a visual dependency inspector could help users understand how values evolve over time. Additionally, adding built-in support for richer error messages and reporting would help users debug complex simulations with greater ease.

		- **Composable Visualisation** \
		We are currently working on integrating composable visualisation support, which will enable users to compose custom graphs using the formula language directly in cells, which would provide the users with greater flexibility for custom visualisations.

		- **User-defined Functions** \
		Introducing custom reusable functions with parameters would help decluttering complex formulas and make the experience with more complex simulations much more enjoyable.
